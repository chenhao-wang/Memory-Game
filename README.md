## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

It's a me memroy game by flipping cards to match the same icons.
if flipped two icons are the same, they'll be visable, else they all be hidden again.

Moves counter and timer are applied to to evaluate a player's perfomance, meanwhile final stars are based on the number of moves.
